This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is modeled after How To GraphQL's [React + Apollo tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/). Some changes have been made, such as converting class components to functional and using the `.graphql` file extension in lieu of `graphql-tag` library.
